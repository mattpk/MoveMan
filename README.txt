While nobody will read this, if you are trying to make this work:

There is one file, res\values\google.xml that I removed my "app_id" and "leaderboard_highscore" strings
Obviously these need to be unique to each app id. and leaderboard id.

Additionally, this was made using AndEngine (it's license included)

You can find my app on android at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qwebox.moveman
